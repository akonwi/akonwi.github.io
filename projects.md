- [Tutor](http://akonwi.github.io/tutor)

  A very basic web app for studying vocabulary words in different languages. I'm learning French and I wanted a flashcard like system that worked the way I wanted. I also wanted to make a desktop app with HTML and coffeescript so I initially created it using [node-webkit](http://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and NeDB for simple nosql storage but moved to a pure web page for accessibility. More details can be found in the [source at github](http://github.com/akonwi/tutor)

- [Git-plus](http://atom.io/packages/git-plus)

  Package for Github's atom editor. It allows doing git-y stuff from the editor without a terminal. As a vim user, I'm very used to Tim Pope's [vim-fugitive](http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and wanted that same feel for atom.

- [Ezlinkedin](http://github.com/akonwi/ezlinkedin)

  Ruby gem I wrote while working on intrnhuntr.com. This gem makes calls on the Linkedin API. There was another gem at the time I wrote this but it was not working for me so I started it over from ground up and made changes to suit my purposes. It just works...and it's pretty well documented I think.
