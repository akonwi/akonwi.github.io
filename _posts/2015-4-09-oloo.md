Back in the fall, I watched a talk by Douglas Crockford about javascript and ES6. He said he was no longer using the keyword `new` in his code because `Object.create` is here.A lot of things he discussed prompted me to try and better understand what makes javascript javascript. So I explored this `Object.create` thing and I really like it.

`Object.create` is a method that will create an object for you and link it to the object that you pass in as the first parameter. As is, javascript is not __really__ "object oriented" like Java because it does not have classes. It has functions that if called with `new` in front, will return an object which we think is an instance of a class. Javascript is a bunch of objects linked prototypically rather than instances of classes. The notion of classes in javascript is a facade at best. [Here is a much better explanation](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/ch4.md) of why classes in javascript are not a good way to write javascript.

The real topic here though is OLOO(aka Objects Linked to Other Objects). I unknowingly started writing my javascript code in OLOO style after the Douglas Crockford talk but only recently did I learn to call it OLOO from Kyle Simpson's open source book about javascript. ([You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)) Basically, OLOO stems from the Delegation pattern which can be seen in javascript prototypes. For instance, rather than doing inheritance like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
// Traditional 'class' setup
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}
Person.prototype.holler = function() {
  console.log("MY NAME IS " + this.name.toUpperCase() + "!!")
}

function Student(name, major) {
  Person.call(this, name)
  this.major = major
}
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person) // need to 'extend' the prototype of Person
Student.prototype.study = function() {
  console.log("I'm studying", this.major)
}
var me = new Student('akonwi', 'business')
me.holler() // MY NAME IS AKONWI!!
me.study() // I'm studying business
{% endhighlight %}

we can do this in OLOO style:

{% highlight javascript %}
var Person = {
  init: function(name) {
    this.name = name
  },
  holler: function() {
    console.log("MY NAME IS " + this.name.toUpperCase() + "!!")
  }
}

var Student = Object.create(Person)
Student.create = function(name, major) {
  this.init(name)
  this.major = major
}
Student.study = function() {
  console.log("I'm studying", this.major)
}

var me = Student.create('akonwi', 'business')
me.holler() // MY NAME IS AKONWI!!
me.study() // I'm studying business
{% endhighlight %}

A huge benefit of this is that the model is easy to track. `Student` is prototypically linked to `Person` and we know that for sure because of `Object.create(Person)` creates that link for us. `Object.create` also allows us to do type checking easily with `Person.isPrototypeOf(me)`, which returns true or false. There are some minor tradeoffs to this way of writing code but I won't cover that here since it can be found in Kyle's book. I love this way of modeling inheritance in javascript because it seems more proper and natural but it also resembles ruby in a sense. Using `Object.defineProperty`, one can create an extendable object that is immutable. Meaning the only way to get an `instance` of it is to call `Person.extend` or something like that and it will return a new object linked to the Person object.
