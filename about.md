I'm a software engineer at ThoughtWorks. I did my undergraduate schooling at Wheaton College (IL) studying Business/Economics and Computer Science.

I like to read (especially code), write code, and learn about nearly anything.

Writing code for the web platform is something I really enjoy, so this blog is a playground for projects and things.
